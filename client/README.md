# Client

This is the frontend of the project.

## Development

### Bun

Bun is similar to Node, but it is written in Rust and is much faster.
A few thing it offers are: package management, bundling, and running
the project.

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/), but Node works just as well
without having to modify anything!

### Unix/MacOS/Windows

#### Dependencies

```
